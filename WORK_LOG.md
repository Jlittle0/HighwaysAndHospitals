| September 11 |  8:00-8:45am  |                                      Worked on trying to figure out how the problem itself actually worked by drawing out multiple examples of highways and hospitals. By doing this, I learned that the cheapest way to find the total cost is to just have one hospital per cluster and connect the rest of the nodes by having 1 road each. Because of this discovery, I realized the main problem I needed to solve was how to find out how many independent clusters there were for the given number of citites. |
| September 11 | 10:00-10:45am | Began implementing my ideas for solving the problem set by finding out how many different independent clusters of cities  there were. I approached this by creating an array that was meant to hold a value for whether a city had already been visited or not (aka whether it's in the same cluster as the origin city) and to run BFS to continue that. Once BFS runs out, check if visited list is all visited, if not, increase cluster count by one and then rerun with the first city that hasn't been visited. |
