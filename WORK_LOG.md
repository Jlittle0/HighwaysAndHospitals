| September 11 |  8:00-8:45am  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Worked on trying to figure out how the problem itself actually worked by drawing out multiple examples of highways and hospitals. By doing this, I learned that the cheapest way to find the total cost is to just have one hospital per cluster and connect the rest of the nodes by having 1 road each. Because of this discovery, I realized the main problem I needed to solve was how to find out how many independent clusters there were for the given number of citites. |
| September 11 | 10:00-10:45am |                                                                               Began implementing my ideas for solving the problem set by finding out how many different independent clusters of cities  there were. I approached this by creating an array that was meant to hold a value for whether a city had already been visited or not (aka a map for whether it's in the same cluster as the origin city) and to run BFS to continue that. Decided to use BFS because I wanted to go through the entirety of each cluster and it's one of the ways I know to do that. Once BFS runs out, check if visited list is all visited, if not, increase cluster count by one and then rerun with the first city that hasn't been visited. |
| September 11 | 10:45-11:20am |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Continued working on implementation of BFS and got the algorithm to work except it only took into account cities that were the first element of each array. Because of this, some of the cities weren't seen as connected since they were never the first element of any of the arrays but they were in fact connected. To solve this, I basically just doubled the checks, one for the first element and one for the second element and worked on that during class. |
| September 11 |  6:45-7:45pm  | Though this block is an hour instead of 30 minutes, I felt like it made more sense since I was doing the same thing for the entire time. I was working on the implementation of my BFS for both the first and second element, trying to get it to work and finally managed to do so. After getting the first two tests to work successfully, I tried the larger ones which failed either due to the number being wrong or my code being too slow. For the number being incorrect, I remembered that we were returning longs after a while and fixed that by changing some of the numbers to longs for the final return statement, causing integer overflow to not happen. Code is pretty inefficient but it works which I'm happy about. |

Found that there were a lot of index out of bounds errors most likely due to while loops not excecuting correctly and the addition statements at the end when merging roots being incorrect. Will fix soon. |

Changed the parameters for the while loops and got those working but then when running the debugger, realized it was stopping short. Had a break statement instead of a continue that I needed to replace and I never had an if case for if the roots were the same to do nothing and not merge. Finally fixed all that and code runs smoothly. Now time to add comments. |
