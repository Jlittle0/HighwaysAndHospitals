| September 11 |  8:00-8:45am  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Worked on trying to figure out how the problem itself actually worked by drawing out multiple examples of highways and hospitals. By doing this, I learned that the cheapest way to find the total cost is to just have one hospital per cluster and connect the rest of the nodes by having 1 road each. Because of this discovery, I realized the main problem I needed to solve was how to find out how many independent clusters there were for the given number of citites. |

I approached this by creating an array that was meant to hold a value for whether a city had already been visited or not (aka whether it's in the same cluster as the origin city) and to run BFS to continue that. Once BFS runs out, check if visited list is all visited, if not, increase cluster count by one and then rerun with the first city that hasn't been visited. |

Because of this, some of the cities weren't seen as connected since they were never the first element of any of the arrays but they were in fact connected. To solve this, I basically just doubled the checks, one for the first element and one for the second element and worked on that during class. |
| September 11 |  6:45-7:45pm  | Though this block is an hour instead of 30 minutes, I felt like it made more sense since I was doing the same thing for the entire block. I was working on the implementation of my BFS for both the first and second element, trying to get it to work and finally managed to do so. After getting the first two tests to work successfully, I tried the larger ones which failed either due to the nubmer being wrong or my code being too slow. For the number being incorrect, I remembered that we were returning longs after a while and fxes that by changing some of the numbers to longs for the final return statement, causing integer overflow to not happen. Code is pretty inefficient but it works which I'm happy about. |
